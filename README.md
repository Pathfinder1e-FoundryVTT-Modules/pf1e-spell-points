# Pathfinder 1e - Hex Grid Support

A collection of patches to the Pathfinder 1e system to add support for hex grids.

Due to the nature of the code, this module overwrites some core PF1 functions, which may cause compatibility issues with
normal square grids. It is recommended to only enable this module when using hex grids.
